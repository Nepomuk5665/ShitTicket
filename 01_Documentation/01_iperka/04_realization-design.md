### Brainstorm
* We discussed the overall structure of the ticketing system. During a brainstorming session, we focused on the core features: event creation, ticket purchasing via Stripe, and sharing ticket links.
* We also considered how to integrate Firebase for user authentication and ticket data storage, focusing on how tickets would be shared and managed between users and the event organizers.
* Our brainstorming included drawing out the data structure and workflow, which we sketched in **Miro**.
