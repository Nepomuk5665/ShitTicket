## What Could Be Improved
* **iOS Compatibility:** Scanner doesn't work properly on iOS devices

* Security rules need immediate attention

## For Next Time
* Test on all platforms from the start
* Add proper validation early
* Plan more buffer time
* Start documentation earlier
* Implement strict security rules from the beginning
