# How We Gathered Information for Shitticket.ch

## Concept Origin
The concept for **shitticket.ch** emerged from the challenges and costs associated with selling tickets for small-scale events. Our aim was to simplify the process, targeting parties, small events, or niche gatherings. We chose the name "shitticket" for its memorability and potential for word-of-mouth promotion.

## Information Needs

## Information Gathering Techniques

* Discussions with event organizers provided insights into the challenges faced, highlighting the demand for a straightforward ticketing tool.

### Business Model Exploration
* We studied monetization strategies of existing platforms and chose to adopt a transparent fee modelâ€”taking a 10% cut on ticket sales without hidden charges.
* Targeting niche markets like local events and small parties allowed us to avoid direct competition with major players.

### Technical Planning
