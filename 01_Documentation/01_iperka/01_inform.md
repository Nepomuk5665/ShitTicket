# I - Information Gathering (Opera Phase)

When we (Nepomuk and Inaam) started with **shitticket.ch**, we knew we had to understand how the ticket industry works, especially for small events. We looked into how big companies like Ticketcorner handle their business, and we realized that they don't care about the smaller niche markets. They only focus on big concerts, festivals, and large-scale events. This leaves a huge gap for small event organizers who still need an easy and cheap way to sell their tickets online. 

We also explored how other websites charge fees for selling tickets. Most platforms take a percentage, like 10-15%, plus extra fixed fees. This can get expensive fast, especially if you're organizing small events with low ticket prices. That's when we got the idea to keep it simple and affordable â€“ we take 10%, but no hidden fees or extra costs. That way, people hosting small events or parties can sell their tickets without worrying about losing a lot of money.

The name **shitticket.ch** also came from us wanting to be memorable. It's funny, a bit edgy, and makes people laugh, so it sticks in their heads. It fits with our goal of making event organizing more casual and less corporate-feeling.
