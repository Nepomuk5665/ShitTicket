# How we gathered the information for this project

## How did we get the idea
* The idea behind **shitticket.ch** came from realizing that selling tickets for small events is often complicated or expensive. We wanted to create a simple way for people to sell tickets for things like parties, small events, or niche gatherings. We figured that a name like "shitticket" would be memorable and get people talking, making it easier to spread the word.

## What type of information did we need
* Competitors
  * We needed to know what competitors like Ticketcorner are doing and how much they charge.
* Business model
  * We needed to figure out how to make money with a low-cost, simple solution.
* Niche market
  * We wanted to understand if there was a gap in the market for small events and parties that other big companies ignore.
* Technical requirements
  * We had to figure out what tools we would need to build the website, such as hosting services and payment integration.

## Gathering information
### Market Research
* We looked at other ticket-selling platforms like Ticketcorner, Eventbrite, and Ticketmaster. We found that these platforms mostly focus on big events and charge high fees (sometimes 10-15%). This confirmed our idea that there’s a space for a more affordable, small-scale ticketing solution.
* We talked to friends who have organized events to learn about the problems they face when selling tickets. Their feedback showed that there’s a need for a tool that’s quick, easy, and doesn’t require too much setup.

### Business Model
* We researched how other platforms make money and decided to keep it simple: we would take a 10% cut of the ticket price with no hidden fees. This is less than most big platforms and makes it affordable for smaller events.
* We realized that by targeting niche markets like small parties or local events, we wouldn't be competing directly with the big names, so they’re unlikely to push into our space.

### Technical Requirements
* We researched what tools and platforms we would need to build the site. We needed a web hosting service, a way to generate ticket links, and a secure payment system. We also needed to make sure the platform was easy for users to navigate.

## What type of information did we gather
* Competitors
  * We found that big competitors focus on large events and charge high fees. This leaves a gap for small, affordable solutions.
* Business model
  * We decided that taking a 10% fee would keep things simple and affordable for our users, without adding extra costs.
* Tools needed
  * Web hosting, payment gateways, and a simple ticket-link generator were identified as the main tools we would need.

## Goals
* Build a website that lets people easily create and share ticket links.
  * Measured by having a functional website where users can sell tickets by a specific date.
  * Achievable and realistic for our skillset and resources.
  * Timely: The site should be operational by the end of the project deadline.
* Test the idea by launching a few small events and getting user feedback.
  * Measured by the number of tickets sold and user satisfaction.
  * Achievable with a small budget and network of event organizers.
  * Timely: Feedback should be collected before expanding the platform.

## Tools needed
* **GitHub**
  * For code management and collaboration.
* **Web hosting**
  * We researched several hosting options and chose one that was affordable and scalable for future growth.
* **Payment integration**
  * We chose a payment gateway that allows for easy integration and low transaction fees.
* **Domain**
  * We bought the domain **shitticket.ch** to make the project feel more professional and legit.
* **Web framework**
  * We used a framework that allowed us to quickly build and deploy the site.
