# How we gathered the information for this project

## How did we get the idea
* The idea behind **shitticket.ch** came from realizing that selling tickets for small events is often complicated or expensive. We wanted to create a simple way for people to sell tickets for things like parties, small events, or niche gatherings. We figured that a name like "shitticket" would be memorable and get people talking, making it easier to spread the word.

## What type of information did we need
* Competitors
  * We needed to know what competitors like Ticketcorner and Eventbrite are doing and how much they charge.
* Business model
  * We needed to figure out how to make money with a low-cost, simple solution.
* Niche market
  * We wanted to understand if there was a gap in the market for small events and parties that other big companies ignore.
* Technical requirements
  * We had to figure out what tools we would need to build the website, such as hosting services, payment integration, and how to generate ticket links.

## Gathering information
### Market Research
* We looked at other ticket-selling platforms like Ticketcorner, Eventbrite, and Ticketmaster. We found that these platforms mostly focus on big events and charge high fees (sometimes 10-15%). This confirmed our idea that there’s a space for a more affordable, small-scale ticketing solution.
* We talked to friends who have organized events to learn about the problems they face when selling tickets. Their feedback showed that there’s a need for a tool that’s quick, easy, and doesn’t require too much setup.

### Business Model
* We researched how other platforms make money and decided to keep it simple: we would take a 10% cut of the ticket price with no hidden fees. This is less than most big platforms and makes it affordable for smaller events.
* We realized that by targeting niche markets like small parties or local events, we wouldn't be competing directly with the big names, so they’re unlikely to push into our space.

### Technical Requirements
* We researched what tools and platforms we would need to build the site. We chose **Stripe** as our payment gateway because it’s easy to integrate, has low fees, and works globally. We will use **Hostinger** for hosting and domain services. For development, we will use **VS Code** and **Firebase** to build and manage the website backend.

## What type of information did we gather
* Competitors
  * We found that big competitors focus on large events and charge high fees. This leaves a gap for small, affordable solutions.
* Business model
  * We decided that taking a 10% fee would keep things simple and affordable for our users, without adding extra costs.
* Tools needed
  * Web hosting with **Hostinger**, payment integration via **Stripe**, and a simple ticket-link generator using **Firebase** were identified as the main tools we would need.

## Goals
* Build a website that lets people easily create and share ticket links.
  * Measured by having a functional website where users can sell tickets by the project deadline: **29 October 2024**.
  * Achievable and realistic for our skillset and resources.
  * Timely: The site should be operational by the end of the project deadline.
* Test the idea by launching a few small events and getting user feedback.
  * Measured by the number of tickets sold and user satisfaction.
  * Achievable with a small budget and network of event organizers.
  * Timely: Feedback should be collected before expanding the platform.

## Tools needed
* **GitHub**
  * For code management and collaboration.
* **Hostinger**
  * We will use Hostinger to host the website and buy the domain.
* **Stripe**
  * We chose Stripe for payment integration because it’s easy to implement and has low fees.
* **VS Code**
  * We are using Visual Studio Code for coding and development.
* **Firebase**
  * We will use Firebase to manage the backend and handle database connections for the website.
