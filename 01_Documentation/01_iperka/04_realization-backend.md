# Backend Realization

# [issue #17](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/17)

1. First, I visited the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and created a new project.

   ![Projekt erstellen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/657c7638-907c-425e-a7f0-825e28117e0d)

2. I then gave the project a name that matches the name of our project.

   ![Projektname vergeben](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/665bc0c0-1cb4-4cd8-9ce4-4c61c5c6fae8)

3. Afterward, I chose not to share any data with Google Analytics.

   ![Google Analytics abwählen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2af1cdc2-fc0f-4003-983c-cc422ebe1187)

4. Finally, I reached this screen, confirming that Firebase has been successfully set up for the database.
