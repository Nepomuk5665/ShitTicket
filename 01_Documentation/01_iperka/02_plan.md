# Planning

## How we planned the Shitticket project
### High level steps
1. Brainstorm to identify milestones & tasks.
2. Create a resource plan.
3. Define milestones.
4. Create a task list and time management schedule.

### Resource Plan
* @tbz-neil-devlin set the project deadline for **29 October 2024** and established a timeline from **27 August 2024** onward.
* We have a total period of 220 hours. 
* Based on the schedule in **[ShitTicket/01_Documentation/03_timeTable.csv](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/blob/main/01_Documentation/03_timeTable.csv)**, we allocated work across the team (Nepomuk and Inaam) based on availability in the mornings, afternoons, and evenings.
  * **N = Nepomuk**
  * **I = Inaam**
* We calculated the available hours and made sure they align with the work estimates.

| Day       | Morning | Afternoon | Evening |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 12.09.2024|    N    |           |    N+I  |
| 13.09.2024|    N    |           |    I    |
| ...       |    N    |           |    N+I  |

### Using GitHub for task management
* We decided to manage the project tasks and milestones through GitHub's project management tools.
* The task list includes:
  * **Start date**: When the task starts.
  * **Due date**: Deadline for the task.
  * **Estimated effort**: How long we think it will take.
  * **Actual effort**: How long it actually took.

### Milestones

### Task list
* We created a list of tasks and assigned them based on their relevance to each milestone.
* Each task includes an estimate of how long it will take, with start and due dates.
* Tasks include setting up Firebase, implementing Stripe, and developing the front-end UI in line with the design from **Figma**.
* We first created our to do list on Microsoft To Do, but then we decided to transfer the whole to do list to Github. 
* Example tasks:
  * Set up Firebase AppCheck for secure data handling.
  * Integrate Stripe for secure payments.
  * Develop ticket-creation interface (based on the Figma design).
* GitHub to do list:

* Microsoft to do list:
* Since we found it easier and more practical to use only one of the To Do lists, we decided to use only the To Do list in Github.

### Task Management
* Weekly meetings to review and update the task list, ensuring mutual accountability and progress.


### Checking progress
* We track our progress by comparing **Actual Effort** to the **Estimated Effort** in GitHub's issue tracker.
* As new tasks arise, we add them to the task list and update the due dates accordingly.

### Visuals
* **Miro board**: Contains the data structure and workflow sketch.
* **Figma UI Design**: Shows the layout and design of the user interface.
