# Frontend: Design of the website [issue #01](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/1)
* Before we could start coding, we had to create a design of what our website should look like. 
* For this part we used “figma.com”. 
* We also started there to discuss what we wanted to have on the website and what the users had to enter to sell and buy their tickets.
#### Design:

# Frontend: Creation of the logo [issue #22](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/22)
* This issue is about the logo of our website.
* For this problem we used ChatGPT to create our logo.
* It was not easy to find the right logo, because we had to explain in detail how our logo should look like. We spent approximately 50min. It took a long time until a design was generated, and the logos didn't catch our eye or didn't look the way we wanted them to.
* We had to write things like: The logo should be black, It should be in the shape of a ticket, The logo should say SHITTICKET, It should have a golden writing
