# Frontend 
* I first researched on w3shools how to program a website with html to refresh my knowledge.
* ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2a6c5ce-355e-4f96-9a65-1d1870221fcb)

* After that I started to program the basics.
* With label, title and text.
* This was not so problematic for me as I have programmed such websites before.
* After that I designed the website using css
* Then I put our logo in the header
* To do this, I created the logo with AI.
