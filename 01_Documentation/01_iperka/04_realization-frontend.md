# Frontend 
* I first researched on w3shools how to program a website with html to refresh my knowledge.
* After that I started to program the basics.
* With label, title and text.
* This was not so problematic for me as I have programmed such websites before.
* After that I designed the website using css
* Then I put our logo in the header
* To do this, I created the logo with AI.


* With that, I have successfully resolved [issue #24](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/24).
