# Frontend: Design of the website [issue #01](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/1)
* Before we could start coding, we had to create a design of what our website should look like. 
* For this part we used “figma.com”. 
* We also started there to discuss what we wanted to have on the website and what the users had to enter to sell and buy their tickets. 

# Frontend: Creation of the logo [issue #22](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/22)
* This issue is about the logo of our website.
* For this problem we used AI to create our logo.
* It was not easy to find the right logo, because we had to explain in detail how our logo should look like. We spent approximately 50min. It took a long time until a design was generated, and the logos didn't catch our eye or didn't look the way we wanted them to.  

 # Frontend: buy ticket page [issue #23](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/issues/23)
* We first researched on w3shools how to program a website with html to refresh my knowledge.
* After that we started to program the basics.
* With label, title and text.
* This was not so problematic for me as I have programmed such websites before.
* After that we designed the website using css
* Then we put our logo in the header
