# Assessment
## What Went Well
* **Stripe Integration:** Successfully implemented payment system with automatic QR code generation
* **Firebase Setup:** Database and authentication working smoothly
* **Mobile Design:** Website works well on most devices
* **QR System:** Scanner works on most platforms and validates tickets correctly
* **Task Management:** GitHub issues helped track progress and problems
* **Weekly Reviews:** Regular Tuesday meetings helped track and close issues effectively

## What Could Be Improved
* **iOS Compatibility:** Scanner doesn't work properly on iOS devices
* **Price Validation:** Should have added minimum price check earlier
* **Date Validation:** Missing check for past dates
* **IBAN Payouts:** Still manual process, should be automatic
* **Code Review:** Should have reviewed code more regularly
* **Security Rules:** Firebase security rules should have been stricter to prevent unauthorized access to user data
* **Data Privacy:** Need better isolation between users to ensure data separation

* Actual hours used ([actualTimeTable.csv](https://github.com/Nepomuk5665/ShitTicket/blob/main/01_Documentation/03_timeTables/02_actualTimeTable.csv)): 180 hours

#### Time Breakdown

#### Weekly Progress
* Week 1: Logo design and Firebase setup (19 hours)
* Week 2: Authentication and frontend pages (23 hours)
* Week 3: Firebase security and backend connection (30 hours)
* Week 4: Payment system and QR generation (32 hours)

### What We Learned
* Start testing on iOS earlier
* Add input validation from the start
* Plan more time for documentation
* Security rules should be thoroughly planned and tested
* User data isolation should be a top priority from the beginning
* Weekly reviews were valuable for tracking progress
* Time estimates were fairly accurate (used 180 of 201 planned hours)

### Open Issues
* 5 major issues still open
* Not enough time to fix all problems
* Need about 20 more hours to complete everything
* Security rules need immediate attention

## For Next Time
* Test on all platforms from the start
* Add proper validation early
* Plan more buffer time
* Start documentation earlier
* Implement strict security rules from the beginning
* Add comprehensive tests for data access controls
* Continue weekly review meetings - they proved very effective
* Better balance workload between team members
