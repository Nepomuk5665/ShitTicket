# How We Plan to Build ShitTicket.ch

## Project Idea
We want to build shitticket.ch because small event organizers have problems with expensive ticket sites. Big sites like Ticketcorner charge too much for small parties and events. Our site will be simple and affordable.

## What We Need to Know
* **Other Ticket Sites:** Look at Ticketcorner and Eventbrite prices
* **Pricing:** Figure out appropriate fee structure
* **Technical Stuff:** Learn what tools we need
* **Laws:** Check rules about selling tickets online

## How We'll Get Information
### Looking at Other Sites
* Check prices on Ticketcorner and Eventbrite
* Ask friends who organize parties what they need
* See what problems people have with big ticket sites

### Pricing Structure
* Competitive fee - only take 10% of ticket price
* No hidden costs
* Use Stripe for secure payments

### Technical Tools We'll Use
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Firebase (it's free and easy)
* **Payments:** Stripe (works everywhere)
* **Website:** Hostinger (affordable and reliable)
* **Code Writing:** VS Code
* **Planning:** Figma for design, Miro for ideas
